# Matrix Multiplication (NxM)

In this report our purpose is similar to previous one - [Report4](https://github.com/AdriannaUrbanska/Introduction-to-CUDA-and-OpenCL/tree/master/Report4) - we wrote a code with matrix multiplication algorithm using shared memory. One change is that our matrix does not have to be square this time.
