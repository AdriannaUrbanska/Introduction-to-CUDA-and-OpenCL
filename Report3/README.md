# CUDA Memory Management analysis

In this report we tested `cudaMallocManaged` function behavior in four different situations when Unified Memory is accessed:
* only by the GPU,
* only by the CPU,
* first by the GPU then the CPU,
* first by the CPU then the GPU.

To analyze our results we used NVIDIA Visual Profiler output. 


### 1. Access only by the GPU

### 2. Access only by the CPU

### 3. Access first by the GPU then the CPU

### 4. Access first by the CPU then the GPU
